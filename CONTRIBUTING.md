## Machine Setup

Follow these steps, running mentioned commands in the terminal:
- Ensure [pre-requisites](README.md#pre-requisites)
- Fork project repo
- cd into project
- `gem install bundler`
- `bundle`
- Once done, open a pull request with master branch.

## Running Samples

Locally, you can just run the following since you have the glimmer-dsl-tk library file locally (as opposed to an installed gem):

```
ruby -r ./lib/glimmer-dsl-tk samples/hello/hello_tab.rb 
```
